## Troubleshooting

### I can ping my java server but i can not join
You may check the following: Do not have both srv and a cname records on the same subdomain also please check if you set the target of ANY record (also an srv record) directly to the protected cname. If all this was done you may check if you added the domain you want to connect with in our panel.

### I can not reach my java server at all
